# Sports day APP

## Technologies Used

1. React
2. JavaScript
3. React router (for routing)
4. Tailwind CSS (styling)
5. Material UI (custom styles)
6. Jest (unit testing)

## Security and accessibility
1. Responsiveness across all devices (Mobile, Laptop, and Desktop)
2. If the user tries to input a userid shorter than 7 characters ui will error handle it via onChnage. But in case 
   it somehow bypasses it backend will throw an error for which the ui will again display the error.

## Things to take care of 
1. form resizes when error messages are shown
2. webvitals
3. Store all constants and strings in a utils folder
4. Add search and sort field for all events and selected events
5. Combine your frontend and backend into one folder structure 
6. accessibility
